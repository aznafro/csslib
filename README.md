# CSS Library

My first CSS Library. Currently includes a grid system that works not only with rows but also columns. The column was put in place in the hopes of supporting a horizontally scrolling website, rather than how every website currently behaves scrolling vertically. 

Also includes a basic reset, some typography settings, bottom margins on text, links, buttons and a nav bar. 

I also decided to use the SASS preprocessor to write this library because I hardly ever use SASS. I thought it would be good practice and a way for me to see why SASS is so useful and widely used in companies. And I have found that it includes the basic structures of a scripting language like: variables, functions, loops, conditionals, and arithmatic. It is these features, mixed in with CSS, that make it easy to organize, reuse and write CSS.
